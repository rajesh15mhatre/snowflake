# Data Warehouse 
- A data warehouse is created by combining and optimizing multiple operational (HR/Sales) data sources for analysis and reporting
- First, we extract raw data from operational DB to avoid impacting production in the stage layer
- Then we integrate, clean, transform data, and establish relationships in integration layer
- then we have an access layer used by downstream apps like reporting, data science or other in access layer

# Cloud computing
- We don't have to worry about Physical/Virtual machine and storage all managed by the cloud provider
- We don't have to manage software, data, OS all are managed by SnowFlake
- We just have to manage applications and tables

 # Snowflake features/editions
 - Standard: intro level. Complete DWH, data encryption, support of broad data types, time travel, DR for 7 days, network policy, secure data share, Federated auth & SSO, premier support 24/7

 - Business critical: higher protection for extremely sensitive data. Provides all Enterprise Features, additional security features like Customer encryption, support for data-specific regulation, DB failover DR
 - Virtual private: highest level security. Provides all Business-critical features, dedicated virtual server with isolated env, dedicated metadata store, snowflake account

# snowflake(SF) pricing
- price is decoupled and between storage and compute and priced individually as required
- Compute consists:
  - Active warehouse - std query processing
    - charged for active warehouses per hour
    - Billed by seconds (min of 1 min)
    - Depending upon the size of the virtual warehouse size ie compute power also matters. ex price like for XS,S,M,L,XL size WH SF charges 1,2,4,8,16 credits
    - if summarized, billed on **Time, active warehouses, and size**
    - We are charged in credit then credit is converted into currency
    - for std, enterprise and businees critical SF charges per hour $2,$3 and $4 credit and for virtual private need to contact SF under US region and AWS platform. it will be different for other selection.
  - Cloud Services - Background cloud service task (charged only when exceeds 10% of warehouse consumption)
  - Serverless - Search optimization Snowpipe auto resizes

# SF data storage and transfer cost
- Storage
  - monthly fee for average monthly data used based on could provider ex: 1TB $40
  - cost calculated after data compression
  - we can save cost by reserving space and making upfront payment if we are sure of usages
- Data transfer 
  - Data ingress is free. data egress is chargable.
  - same region data transfer within SF is free. Other regions and other cloud provider is chargeable

  # Usage:
  - We can monitor usage under Admin -> cost management. Here we can see detail break down of the consumption by storage, WH, compute, data transfer and so on 

  # Resource Monitor - available from std edition
  - we can set monthly spend threshold and set below actions when %threshold quota is used. These can be done only by ACCOUNTADMIN role user or user with delegated permissions:
    - Notify when %X quota is used
