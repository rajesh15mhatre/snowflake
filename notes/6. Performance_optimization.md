# Performance Optimization
## Overview
- It makes run query faster and saves the cost
- Traditional ways of optimization which snowflake manages automatically
  - Add indexes and PK
  - Create table partitions
  - Analyse the query execution plan
  - Remove unnecessary full table scans
- SF automatically manages micro partitions, sizing virtual Warehouses(VWH) and clusterkeys
- OPtimizations ways
  - Dedicated VWH: for different workloads for different groups of peoples
  - Scaling UP: for known patterns of high workload
  - Scaling Out: for unknown patterns of workloads
  - Maximize Cache: automatic cache can be maximized
  - Cluster Keys: for large tables,

# Create dedicated virtual warehouses
- identify and classify different team in org with different workload needs. Ex. BI, DS, Mktg
- for every class of workload create dedicated VWH & assign users
- Avoid too many VWHs, to avoid underutilization
- Refine classification of workload or user groups needs time to time
