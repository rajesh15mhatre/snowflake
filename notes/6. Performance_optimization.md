# Performance Optimization
## Overview
- It makes run query faster and saves the cost
- Traditional ways of optimization which snowflake manages automatically
  - Add indexes and PK
  - Create table partitions
  - Analyse the query execution plan
  - Remove unnecessary full table scans
- SF automatically manages micro partitions, sizing virtual Warehouses(VWH) and clusterkeys
- OPtimizations ways
  - Dedicated VWH: for different workloads for different groups of peoples
  - Scaling UP: for known patterns of high workload
  - Scaling Out: for unknown patterns of workloads
  - Maximize Cache: automatic cache can be maximized
  - Cluster Keys: for large tables,

# Create dedicated virtual warehouses
- identify and classify different team in org with different workload needs. Ex. BI, DS, Mktg
- for every class of workload create dedicated VWH & assign users
- Avoid too many VWHs, to avoid underutilization
- Refine classification of workload or user groups needs time to time

# Implement dedicated VWH
```
//  Create virtual warehouse for data scientist & DBA
// Data Scientists
CREATE WAREHOUSE DS_WH 
WITH
WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'
WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD' 
AUTO_SUSPEND = 300

```
## Scaling up/down
- Change size of VWH as during different workload times of the day. LIke ETL runs at specific time or business event
- scaling up/down is suitable in case of query complexity NOT more users
- We can use ALTER WAREHOUSE query to set size of warehouse same can be done from admin console

## Scaling out
- means using additional warehouses or multicluster warehouses. We can automate this scaling process
- It's suitable when there are more concurrent users/queries
Considerations:
- at least Enterprise edition all WH should be multicluster

```
// We will run below query in 8to9 to worksheets say 8to9 concurruntely to see how cluster get spin up when the load is increased and again snips down when the load is released
// We can check WH cluster count under admin->WH console
/ Once cluster snips up suspend WH and all queries to save credits

SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF100TCL.WEB_SITE T1
CROSS JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF100TCL.WEB_SITE T2
CROSS JOIN SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF100TCL.WEB_SITE T3
CROSS JOIN (SELECT TOP 57 * FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF100TCL.WEB_SITE)  T4
```
## Caching
- This automatical process to speed up the queries
- IF query is executed twice, results are cached and can be re-used
- Results are cached for 24 hours or until underlying data had changed
- To ensure that caching happens make sure that those queries should be running on same WH

```
// Query first time takes 2.1 sec and second time 110ms as first-time table scan take longer time to scan entire table with 200mill records 
SELECT AVG(C_BIRTH_YEAR) FROM SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCDS_SF100TCL.CUSTOMER

// Setting up an additional user and try to run the above query under same WH will utilize the cache and return result faster
CREATE ROLE DATA_SCIENTIST;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE DATA_SCIENTIST;
CREATE USER DS1 PASSWORD = 'DS1' LOGIN_NAME = 'DS1' DEFAULT_ROLE='DATA_SCIENTIST' DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = 'DS_WH'  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE;
GRANT ROLE DATA_SCIENTIST TO USER DS1;
// Try running the same query with a new user and under the same WH. Observe the execution time.

//Drop table at the end
DROP ROLE DATA_SCIENTIST;
DROP USER 

```
