# Snowflake notes 

## Snowflake Architecture
Three main components are Cloud Services, Query Processing, and Storage

1. Storage: 
- Used to store data on cloud provider service.
- Columnar storage saved in blobs
2. Query Processing:
- Muscle of the system
- Performs MMP (Massive Parallel Processing
3. Could services:
- Brain of the system
- Security, Metadata, Access control, security, and managing infra

## Warehouse sizes
XS: 1server: 1 credit per hour 
S: 2 server: 2 --""--
M: 4 Server
L: 8 servers
XL 26 Servers
4XL: 128 servers

We can also use multiple clusters of the above servers like 2 S servers 

Create a warehouse : 
Role of account 
- Security admin is 2nd powerful after the Account Admin role
- Public role doesn't have access to the warehouse
- SysAdmin can create a warehouse
- Sec

## Manage warehouse using SQL:
```
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;

CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE SECOND_WH
WITH 
WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XSMALL
AUTO_SUSPEND = 300 --automatically suspend the virtual warehouse after 5 mins of not being used
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
SCALING_POLICY = 'Economy' 
MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3
INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE

COMMENT = "THIS IS our second warehouse";


DROP WAREHOUSE SECOND_WH;


ALTER WAREHOUSE SECOND_WH SUSPEND; --to suspend
ALTER WAREHOUSE SECOND_WH RESUME;

ALTER WAREHOUSE SECOND_WH SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'; --can be used without quotes
ALTER WAREHOUSE SECOND_WH SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 300; 
```

## Multi Clustering 
 - your WH can auto-scale up/down multiple clusters as per workload
 -  There are two scaling policies:
   - Standard: favors starting additional WH
     - Prevents/minimizes queuing by favoring the starting of additional clusters
     - clusters start immediately when either query is queued or the system detects more queries than can be executed by the currently available clusters.
     - Cluster shuts down after 2-3 consecutive successful checks - performed at 1-minute intervals, determining whether the load on the least-loaded cluster could be redistributed to another cluster.  
   - Economy: Favors conserving credits rather than starting additional WH
     - Conserves credits by favoring keeping the running cluster fully loaded rather than starting an additional cluster, which may result in queries being queued and taking longer to complete
     - Cluster starts only if the system estimates there's enough query load to keep the cluster busy for at least 6 minutes.
     - Cluster shuts down after 5-6 consecutive successful checks - performed at 1-minute intervals, determining whether the load on the least-loaded cluster could be redistributed to another cluster.  
### Create DB and objects
- To create a database we can use the "DATA" menu and use the "+" button to create a DB and other objects like schema, tables & so on. we can use the privilege option to provide access to different roles.

### Loading data
- Load data from S3 bucket:
```
CREATE  OR  REPLACE DATABASE EXCERCISE_DB;

USE EXCERCISE_DB;


CREATE TABLE EXCERCISE_DB.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS (
    ID INT,
    first_name varchar,
    last_name varchar,
    email varchar,
    age int,
    city varchar
);

COPY INTO EXCERCISE_DB.PUBLIC.1000
    FROM s3://snowflake-assignments-mc/gettingstarted/customers.csv
    FILE_FORMAT = (type=csv,
                   field_delimiter = ','
                   skip_header=1
                   );

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
```
