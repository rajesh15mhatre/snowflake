## 103 Understanding zero-copy cloning
The clone command helps us to create a copy of the following objects:
- Database
- Table
- Schema
- Stream
- File Format
- Sequence
- Stage: Named internal stages not cloned
- Task
- Pipe: Only for the external stage
It creates a copy of data, but still refers to the same micro partitions, thus no additional storage is utilized. Storage is only utilized when we change the original or a copy of the table/object.
Below are the feature:
- Cloned object is independant
- Easy to copy all metadata & improved storage management
